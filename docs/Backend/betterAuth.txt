## Better Auth (Node Backend)

Better Auth is used in this Node.js backend to manage authentication, sessions, and account/provider linking. As part of its default setup, it creates the required database tables and indexes to store users, active sessions, linked login providers, and verification tokens.

# Default tables created

1) user
Stores the primary user record (identity/profile and verification state).

2) session
Stores active login sessions (token-based sessions with expiry) for users.

3) account
Stores linked login accounts/providers for a user (for example OAuth providers and/or credentials).

4) verification
Stores short-lived verification entries used for flows like email verification, password resets, and magic links/OTP (depending on enabled features).

# Default indexes created

- Sessions lookup by userId
- Accounts lookup by userId
- Verification lookup by identifier (commonly email)

# Relationships and cleanup

Sessions and accounts are linked to users through foreign keys. When a user is deleted, related sessions and accounts are automatically removed due to cascade delete behavior.
